1: Lion bit my finger!
Part 1: Lion will bite your finger exactly 50% of the time. Firsnt, write a function isBitten() that returns TRUE with 50% probability, and FALSE otherwise. Hint: You may find the rand() function useful.
Part 2: Below the function, write code to generate a webpage that displays “Lion bit your finger!” or “Lion did not bite your finger!” using the isBitten() function.

    Answer: index1.php



2: Counting words
Part 1: Write a function countWords($str) that takes any string of characters and finds the number of times each word occurs. You should ignore the distinction between capital and lowercase letters, and do not have to worry about dealing with characters that are not letters. Hint: Create an associative array mapping word keys to the number of times they occur. You will need to look at PHP's string functions to split a sentence into words.
Hint 2: The print_r($array_name) function is useful for examining the contents of an array.
Part 2: In the same file, write a form consisting of a single text field and a submit button. The “action” attribute to the form should be the same page that the form is on (don’t hard code, use $_SERVER[‘PHP_SELF’]). The form should send the contents of the text field via GET.
Upon submitting the form, you should be redirected to the same page, but the URL should contain the string from the text field as a GET request normally behaves.
Side note: Prevent security vulnerabilities with $_SERVER[‘PHP_SELF’]. For more information, take a look here: http://www.html-form-guide.com/php-form/php-form-action- self.html
Part 3: Check for the existence of a GET request. If a GET request exists with the name of the input field that you made in Part 2, run the contents of the request through your countWords($str) function. Take the output array of the function, and display an HTML table of words and the number of times they occur. Make the table sorted by decreasing number of occurrences.

        Answer: index2.php
